Cacheline-Conscious Extendible Hashing (CCEH)

One of the main challenges in implementing hash-based indexing structures on PM is how to achieve efficiency by making effective use of cachelines while guaranteeing failure-atomicity for dynamic hash expansion and shrinkage.

reduces the overhead of dynamic memory block management while guaranteeing constant hash table lookup time.

CCEH guarantees failure-atomicity without making use of explicit logging.
